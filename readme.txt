A plugin that generates geo targeted cloaked affiliate links.

== Description ==

This plugin generates geo targetted cloaked affiliate links. These links can be placed into content manually or if a keyword/phrase is specified, links will be added into content automatically.

This plugin relies on the Region Detect plugin to do the geo targetting.

== Installation ==

1. This first step is optional, but it does make the plugin much more powerful - download and install the Region Detect plugin.
1. Extract the zip file and just drop the contents in the <code>wp-content/plugins/</code> directory of your WordPress installation.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' page.
